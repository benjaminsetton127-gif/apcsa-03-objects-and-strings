 * Exercise 1 — MadLibs
 *
 * Declare at least 6 variables of mixed types (int, double,
 * String, char, boolean), then concatenate them into a paragraph.
 *
 * Requirements:
 *   - At least one computed value printed inside parentheses,
 *     e.g. ... + (price * quantity) + ...
 *   - At least one char and one boolean in the output
 *   - The result should actually be funny. That's a requirement.
